**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 01 of Javascript30

**Thoughts** I've recently started working through Javascript30. I've been doing java development for around 10 years, but javascript is new to me. I decided to start on pure javascript as I'm dangerous enough with js to piece together a service following examples, but the methods and syntax are still cumbersome to me. I don't know enough basic javascript to sit down and write something from scratch.

My goal is that by the end of the 30 tutorials I will be able to sit down and write work through these

### Day 2: June 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 02 of Javascript30

**Thoughts** With a few hints from the video and built out example, I was able to fill in a lot of this myself. I'm really happy with the progress I made. And coming out of the end of it with a working ticking clock was really cool to see.

### Day 3: June 07, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Day 03 of Javascript30

**Thoughts** This day was working with CSS variables in javascript. Mostly dealing with css syntax for variables and methods I hadn't used in javascript yet. Was very informative, but not one I was able to try myself before watching the video. The finished image manipulation was cool to see. I can see the versatility of setting css properties from javascript.
